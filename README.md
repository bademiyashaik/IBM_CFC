# IBM_CFC
Travelling Assistant.
In this project we are going to develop an android application which is used to guide the travellers through different monuments, restuarants, and hotels.
We will be using "IBM cloud facilities" as a database to store the required information and will use the data for the further use.
To develop the android application we wii be using the "Android Studio" as the base application software creator.
